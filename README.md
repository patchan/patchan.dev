Welcome! This is the source code for my personal website at [patchan.dev](https://patchan.dev).

The site is designed by me with accessibility at its core. Read more about improving digital accessibility at the [a11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com) and accessibility standards at [w3c](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility).
